   - Model: phi4-mini-reasoning:3.8b (emotional intent)
   - Empathetic, caring response
   - Lowercase, warm tone

#### Scenario C: Coding Question
1. Send: "how do i write a for loop in javascript?"
2. Expect:

   - Technical but friendly response
   - Code examples if appropriate

#### Scenario D: Indonesian Message

2. Expect:
   - Detected language: Indonesian
   - Response entirely in Indonesian
   - Lowercase, natural Indonesian slang

#### Scenario E: Model Failure Test
1. Temporarily set emotional model to bad one: `gemma3:1b-it-qat`
2. Send emotional message
3. Expect:
   - Log: "⚠️ Primary model failed, trying fallback"
   - Log: "✅ Fallback model succeeded"
   - Still get proper response
   - Log shows attemptedModels array

#### Scenario F: Memory Persistence
1. Send: "my name is sarah and i love cats"
2. Restart bot (Ctrl+C, then `node bot.js` again)
3. Send: "do you remember me?"
4. Expect:
   - Bot recalls your name and cat preference
   - References past conversation

## 📊 Log Monitoring

### Good Patterns ✅
```
✅ Socket connected
🧩 AI response generated
💾 Memory saved to file
🔄 Attempting fallback model: phi4-mini-reasoning:3.8b
✅ Fallback model succeeded
```

### Warning Patterns ⚠️
```
⚠️ Primary model failed, trying fallback
⚠️ Skipping trivial consecutive message
⚠️ All AI models failed, using hardcoded fallback
```

### Error Patterns ❌
```
❌ api or handler error: Request failed with status code 500
❌ Embedding generation failed
❌ Failed to save memory
```

### What to Watch For
- If you see frequent "Primary model failed" → consider changing primary model
- If you see "All AI models failed" → check your AI server health
- If you see "Request failed with status code 500" → that model is down

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Test Locally
```bash
cd /home/wush/botwa
node bot.js
```

### Step 2: Verify QR Code Login
- Scan QR with WhatsApp
- Wait for "✅ Socket connected" message

### Step 3: Send Test Messages
- Send from allowed contact
- Verify responses work
- Check different languages
- Test emotional vs technical messages

### Step 4: Check Logs
```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
node bot.js | tee bot.log

# In another terminal:
tail -f bot.log | grep "⚠️\|❌\|✅"
```

### Step 5: Deploy to Kubernetes
```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t botwa:latest .

# Push to registry
docker tag botwa:latest your-registry/botwa:latest
docker push your-registry/botwa:latest

# Update deployment
kubectl set image deployment/botwa botwa=your-registry/botwa:latest
kubectl rollout status deployment/botwa

# Check pod logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/botwa
```

- Acceptable: <15%
- Problem: >20% (primary model unreliable, switch it)

### Hardcoded Fallback Rate
- Target: 0%
- Acceptable: <1%
- Problem: >1% (all models failing, server issue)

### Memory Growth
- Target: Stable <200MB RAM
- Acceptable: <500MB RAM

## 🎉 You're Ready!

### Final Status
```
Code:        ✅ READY
Config:      ✅ OPTIMIZED
Models:      ✅ VERIFIED
Fallbacks:   ✅ TESTED
Memory:      ✅ PERSISTENT
Docs:        ✅ COMPLETE
```

### Start the Bot
```bash
node bot.js
```

### Monitor Production
```bash
# Watch for issues
kubectl logs -f deployment/botwa | grep "❌\|⚠️"

# Check model selection
kubectl logs deployment/botwa | grep "🤖 Adaptive model selection"

# Monitor fallbacks
kubectl logs deployment/botwa | grep "fallback"
```

---

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### Bot Won't Start
```bash
# Check dependencies
npm install

# Check config
node -e "console.log(require('./config'))"

# Check Node version
node --version  # Should be v14+
```

### Bot Not Responding
- Check if sender is in ALLOWED_CONTACTS
- Check WhatsApp connection status
- Check AI server is reachable: `curl https://ai.wush.site/v1/models`

### Getting 500 Errors
- Check logs for which model is failing
- Test model manually with benchmark.sh
- Switch to different model in config.js

### Memory Growing
- Check for stuck timers/intervals
- Verify saveMemory() is being called
- Check messageBuffer isn't growing unbounded
